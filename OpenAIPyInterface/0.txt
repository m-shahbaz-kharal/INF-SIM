[00:44:42] Received: I am A broken space craft pod . I am an unconscious being that is unable to move. My past can be described as:
Manufactured by NASA for interplanetory travel. All communication systems broken. 
Each event in my past has shaped me into who I am today.

Given my history, how will I get affected. Please be specific, don't repeat anything I have said already, and only use first-person perspective (e.g. "because I am an apple and someone ate a part of me, my health is lowered").
