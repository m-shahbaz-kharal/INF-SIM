[00:44:42] Received: I am A young boy named Tim. I am a conscious being that is able to move. My past can be described as:
I just woke up off the space craft pod but I don't see my space craft. The pod is also broken but thank God I am alive. I remember traveling from earth to this far off planet called AlphaKashafOne (AK1) and along with me there were other spacecrafts too, don't know if anyone of them survived. This planet is not good for living as it has no intelligent life as far as we knew but it has very little plant life making it breathable and may have some sort of food too; the earth was ending anyway so we had to travel. The first important thing for me is to survive here; rest I will see along the way.
Each event in my past has shaped me into who I am today.
I am perceiving 2 other entities around me. The other entities are A broken space craft pod , and An Apple 
Given who I am and what I am perceiving now, tell me the next task(s) I should do. Please be specific, don't repeat anything I have said already, and only use first-person perspective (e.g. "I should eat an apple").
